We, our country, has suffered the most severe election interference campaign in history.
For the last four years, former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page found himself at the center of now disproven Trump-Russia collusion allegations.
Last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the FBI's applications for warrants to spy on Carter Page were riddled with serious errors.
Most notably, the applications were all missing a key piece of exculpatory evidence the FBI was aware of, that Carter Page had worked with the CIA to report on his contacts with Russian intelligence.
Former FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, recently pled guilty to altering an email from a CIA liaison.
In the description of paige's relationship with the spy agency, Clinesmith falsely added the words "and not a source".
Page has recently released a new book in the hopes of setting the record straight.
"Abuse and Power: How an Innocent American Was Framed in an Attempted Coup against the President."
This is American Thought leaders, and I'm Jan Jekielek.
Carter Page, such a pleasure to have you on American Thought Leaders.
Great to be with you, Jan.
Thanks a lot for having me.
Well, and this is, I think, the third time that, that I'm having you.
We actually started, I think, the first time in May of 2019 and, my goodness, how things have changed since that time.
You know, actually, when I first talked to you it was very hard, to, be honest, to, to to pull stuff out, but these days, in this book, I can see you're really starting to speak your mind.
Yeah, well, there's a lot that went on, in terms of the intelligence operations.
And I had supported the intelligence community for decades.
And, unfortunately, you know, until the Horowitz Report, the U.S. Department of Justice inspector General produced their report in December of 2019.
You know, some of those, uh, really big details I didn't feel at liberty to get into.
So, the timing was right and it, I think the timing is also right right now, just because, unfortunately, the 2016 election interference has not been completely remedied.
All of the wrongdoing done by the Obama-Biden administration, the DNC, and, really, their colleagues and their cohort in the media, just had such a huge negative impact, not only on President Trump's, uh, then-, you know, that Donald J. Trump's, as a civilian, his, uh, his initial campaign, but it continued through his transition period and throughout the first, at least, at least the initial years of his administration.
So, you know, I had been doing some initial work to try to get, set that record straight, but unfortunately there's really, um, you know, now is the time and I think, particularly now that we're coming up on the next, uh, presidential election, and so many of these, uh, myths, you know, disinformation is still out there.
I thought it was, it was absolutely essential that I, I just tell the full story absolutely.
Absolutely.
So, you know, this IG report from December of last year, you know, as I read it, exonerated you of any wrongdoing.
You were, you know, smeared extensively in something called the Steele Dossier, which is, again, something that we've seen a lot in the media, and, uh, and of course, we've written on about extensively ourselves.
Um, something very significant, uh, uh, has come out, uh, very recently and this is in fact the first, uh, guilty plea in Attorney Durham's investigation into this whole operation, or alleged operation that you were describing.
And so, Kevin Clinesmith, one of the lawyers, um, has pled guilty now, uh, to making a false statement.
And, um, and, uh, faces, I think it's zero to six months, uh, I think is, is, his potential, uh, uh, charge.
What do you make of this?
Do you feel like justice is being done here?
well so going back to the inspector
general report
unfortunately I was told and it's
similar to what we're talking about in
in terms of getting
the truth out with my new book so
unfortunately I was totally blocked from
having any input whatsoever
in that so, you know, they did have
a lot of interviews I think over 100
interviews
in this 400 you know which led to this
480 page document
and unfortunately, you know, a lot of the
same people who were
uh integrally involved in this
wrongdoing
were the ones that were, um,, you know,
they're the ones providing all the
information
so unfortunately I'm and that was
another driver in terms of the reason
why I wanted to
write this book and, you know, I punch
back
quite a bit as to the, uh, you know,
the half-truths and the the continued
lies that are
are in that in that, uh, that document
again I I'm greatly appreciative of
inspector general horowitz and the work
that they started to do
in terms of the initial, you know,
cracking the shell a little bit as to
some of this wrongdoing
but so as to Mr. Clinesmith himself
again one of the breaking news elements
from way back last december and
of course leaked previously I believe in
you know news reports started coming out
something in, uh, in November at some point.
But unfortunately, um, you know, this is
the first time
that, you know, we started we saw some
some ram
uh repercussions for the individuals in
involved but I think
what's particularly interesting about
that, you know, first
charging document is
that there's there's very little, uh,
there's a lot of interesting little
clues as to things that are, uh, I believe
it's paragraph five
actually talks to, you know, broadly
refers to
other people who are involved in this
scheme, you know,
going back way before what, uh,, you know,
what was really known in terms of august
2016
you know months before the, you know, the
efI's
abuse officially began in october
so, you know, the question obviously
becomes
uh so yes, uh, Clinesmith had an important
position
in this very serious process
but, you know, we'll have to wait and see
but
i think it's pretty safe to assume and
there's been a lot of reporting
including in epoch times which has been
you know you guys have been on the front
lines of this
since the the very beginning, uh,
unfortunately there's, um, you know, it
seems like there's
a lot more to come so we shall see well
and
you know this Clinesmith indictment and
you know guilty plea it speaks
of course directly to you because the
the his false statement
was actually altering an email
that the email original email said
yes you had worked with the CIA
basically right and he changed it to
no you had not which is
a little bit important here well
yes however and this goes back to my a
lot the fact that a lot of other people
were involved in this scheme right so
what is that
that is a false statement charge right
well unfortunately we know and again
uh your you and your colleagues have
reported on this
a lot over the last several years, uh,
you know again really on the cutting
edge of this reporting
but, you know, we now know that there are
a lot of other people
you know again comparing reality
to the fictions, you know, some of the
worst fictions going back to the the
very genesis of this
scam operation with the fisa abuse
but unfortunately, um, you know, a lot of
those, uh,
things no one else has, um, has faced any
repercussions as of yet so
you know we'll have to wait and see I i
will say
just from a procedural standpoint you
know I i I mentioned that I was
totally blocked, you know, the privacy act
of 1974
provides various provisions by, you know,
if the government has a
system of records on an individual
before those get released and, you know,
given out to the
to everybody the individual that it's
about
uh has a chance to review them and and
ask for changes
unfortunately, you know, there's been leak
and leak in
dis disclosure after disclosure
over the last several years and, you know,
again a vast proportion of that
information is complete lies
and there's nothing, um, you know, I've
been completely blocked in this process
so
again another reason why it was
important to
set the record straight here well so
it's interesting recently
there was a senate committee report that
came out
where which has a section about you
um in it now I just to be clear the
report
you know meant talks about how there was
no Trump-Russia collusion and the report
doesn't say you deserve to be charged
with anything
it I i did read through it it is
somewhat disparaging however
um what what do you make of this recent
report
well I think it's it just reflects how
pathetic
uh what the senate intelligence
committee did
back in this whole sham unfortunately
and, you know, a lot of the fake news
outlets
would have various reports and they'd
like to spin the senate intelligence
committee's
investigation during those terrible
years
as oh they're being very mature
because the ranking member mark warner
the senator from virginia is
he gets along so well with the chairman
of the committee
uh chairman burr at the time and
unfortunately
you know chairman burr and the
republicans
of that committee were just completely
rolling over
they just sort of let the democrats run
wild and I i can tell you
and I i talk about it within my book
uh, you know, sitting through those
interviews
i mean it's just a really politically
motivated
you know again a lot of baseless
baseless false
theories and unfortunately there's a lot
of conflicts of interest in terms of
what they, uh, the same, you know, members
of congress
so for example, uh, one of the most senior
members of that committee
uh senator feinstein, you know, and you
look at
some of, uh, some of the questions and
issues surrounding her
again a big prominent democrat member of
congress
but unfortunately, you know, I was
i was never given a, uh, a fair shake and
the most
you know one of the biggest elements in
terms of the senate intelligence
committee
is and something I talk about in chapter
five of my book
is the whole, uh, sham with the
quote-unquote
security director of the senate
intelligence
committee and this is a person who I'm
giving all of my
highly, you know, highly confidential
personal information and
you know it's it's now known it be or it
became known
that, uh, he was dating, um,
a journalist from buzzfeed, you know, this
woman ali watkins
so, you know, unfort and then sure enough
uh james wolf who is that security
director
is now a convicted felon is when
eventually there was
some some repercussions
related to this but unfortunately
there's a lot of problems with that
report and I think it
you know sort of follows that same
pattern of
attacking Trump supporters and, you know,
being somewhat
detached from reality but, you know, i
think, uh,
it's unfortunate but, you know, I guess it
is what it is and
it it really discredits, uh,
itself and the people, uh, the members of
of congress the senators who were who
were involved in this
on both sides of the aisle if you will
but what's interesting again going back
to the the fake news and what they would
say
so they would always say well the senate
intelligence committee they're acting
very professional and they're being very
mature
and they would compare that to the
relationship between
uh congressman adam schiff and
then chairman of the house in the house
intelligence committee
uh devin nunes so
but the reality was, you know, when adam
schiff and I i talked about this in
in chapter five of my book, you know,
describing
what it's like being dragged through the
mud in the
in the shift show and unfortunately, um,
or or fortunate in that instance even
though it had
did terrible damage and I got more death
threats when
uh when congressman, um, when congressman
schiff
was reading from the dossier on march
20th
2017 in this big testimony in front of
congress
but, you know, it's one of those things
where
um the
you know justice I think will eventually
be served and
we'll see how it we'll see how it all
plays out but again
um, you know, the fact that those, uh, those
those reports, you know, this on national
television
him, uh, him going on and on like that
leading to
a number of death threats on that same
day, you know,
a little a little after he's saying this
on national television
reading these DNC funded lies, uh, that
were put together
i think it's just really, you know, it
speaks the complete lack of credibility
and
again in terms of maturity and the way
that there is the interaction between
the democrats and the republicans
i think there is a lot, uh,, you know,
huge credit goes out to then chairman
devin nunes who was able to
uncover a lot of this wrongdoing and i
know, uh,
epact times has been, you know, really on
the front lines
in terms of covering the the nunes memo
in, uh,
in february which was released in
february 2018
and the run-up to that so really
important
i want to stick to the to the senate
report just very briefly
because there's an interesting segment
in there
which talks about your past and I'm
actually very very curious about that
because
you know it talks about that you had you
had, uh,, you know, a relationship with the
CIA
and the FBI I think it says up until
2013 I think that's I believe that's
what it says there
and but then you have all these sort of
very
black blocked out area two pages of
of of redaction right and so
I'm very curious about this, you know, as
much as you're at liberty to say what
was the nature of your work with the CIA
and the FBI and did it actually end in
2013
well I, you know, again I i reveal a lot
about that
in my in my book and I think
you know it really is unfortunate it
speaks to the
complete lack of professionalism within
those organizations
during the obama administration and i
think it cuts across
there are a number of intelligence
organizations
who which cut across both the justice
system, you know, there's
elements within doj which serve
intelligence functions
uh for example the administration of the
fisa process
the, uh, all those false warrants which
were submitted by
the likes of james comey and sally yates
you know that that run that was run
although it was put together
by the FBI the doj is is at the center
of it
and so unfortunately, you know, there's
there's a lot to it and, uh, as to your
you know the point you're making as to
the the question and, uh,
the redactions it's hard to say, you know,
what what I've found thus far
is that typically the things that are
redacted are things
that are, you know, positive to, uh,
to telling the truth whereas the stuff
that they want to get out there
is things to advance a a false political
narrative and it's it's unfortunate that
even though
chairman johnson has been doing a lot
and chairman
lindsey graham has been doing quite a
bit in terms of
the getting to the bottom of things with
the with the fisa abuse
it really has been a a horrendous
cover-up and
again it's it's unfortunate that you
know their so-called
security director, um, ended up
providing more leaks and, um,
to the media through, you know, I think
the
the his indictment or one of the chart
one of the documents in that
in that court document, uh, or in that
court docket
against then security director james
wolf says
you know giving this information to
young female reporters
so very unfortunate and just
you know inconsistent with the
professionalism
i I've enjoyed in terms of dealing with
members of the u.s intelligence
community over the decades but, you know,
again I think this initial first step
last week
with the, uh, with the initial steps with
the durham
investigation is a positive sign and
again
I've been highly encouraged that they're
they are starting to follow the law
unlike, you know, all the privacy act
violations
that I've, uh, I've been through over the
last several years
so much more to come I'm, uh, I'm quite
confident
well okay so I want I want to touch a
little bit more on that the questions
a lot of people are very curious what
did you do with the CIA what was your
work
you know I've always served my country
you know i
uh going back to I mean I was an eagle
scout growing up
and, you know, did all kinds of community
service projects and
you know catholic school altar boy I was
um
you know serve my church, uh, serve my
church
community and my, uh, doing everything i
can
and, you know, there's similar there are
similar examples
with the, uh, the, uh, intelligence
community as well
CIA FBI and others so
you know again there's a it's an
interesting little tease I think there's
uh there's a lot more
that I i dig into in my book and that's
okay
good reason to, uh, to dig into it but
um I'm I'm sure, uh, I'm sure people will
benefit from that
and again it just speaks to the complete
deceit
that the democrats and their operatives
within the government have continued to
advance and this just this week we saw
precisely the same thing where we had
four
four nights of the DNC convention
and unfortunately, you know, just like the
sham
in 2016 which created this massive fraud
upon our justice system and the u.s
intelligence community and our our
election process unfortunately, you know,
there were just so many
hateful lies told throughout this
process
and, you know, one example I will give is
uh
sally yates, you know, the former, uh,
i believe, you know, deputy director at
the, uh,
at the justice department who again
signed two of my, uh,
false fisa warrants which had so many
terrible problems
but again just, you know, just this week
just attacking
president Trump in her highly political
speech
without having any, um, repercussions as
to this
terrible fisa abuse during her term on
watch
and, you know, what I find particularly
interesting about that is
as a us military officer as a
former, uh, officer of the deck, uh, in the
in the, uh, in the middle east and in the
mediterranean sea
and, uh, going across the atlantic
you know if I run my ship a ground or if
I'm the officer of the deck
and the ship runs the ground the captain
of the ship
usually faces some consequences right
i think what, you know, this complete sham
what we've seen
again, uh, a response, you know, someone
with significant responsibility mr
Clinesmith
but these people at the very at the
highest levels of these organizations
really the captains of the ship have
faced
no consequences, you know, you talked
about
privacy violations I mean
having a fisa warrant exec executed on
you
is probably one of the most massive
privacy violations
that can exist I mean in theory these
are supposed to be justified against
you know people working with terrorists
or something of the like
at what point in all this did you
become aware that there was something
really strange going on that maybe
you're under surveillance
maybe there's a wiretapping going on
when did that happen
right after the first fisa warrant was
issued
in october of 2016
given these terrible human rights abuses
that were being perpetrated by the obama
biden administration on the Trump
campaign
i sent a letter to the organization for
security and cooperation in europe
which was an election monitor, uh,
looking at the, you know, checking out
whether there is legitimacy
in the u.s election I sent a a letter to
the
chairman of that committee and us you
know the senior person who was running
that, uh, that investigation, um,
you know and and I talk about how
the democrats were doing this
uh spy operation involving
um people from london, you know, and
and I i speak to that explicitly
in my, uh, in my letter now I didn't have
all the details i
again I'm close with various people inc
in with deep ties in the intelligence
community and
you know both in and out of government
so
i was given a tip back, uh,
you know several, you know, right around
the time of the
defamatory news report, uh, from yahoo
news which would then
become the basis for this, uh, fraudulent
uh fisa warrant or part of the basis
fascinating but you had no idea that
fisa system was being invoked
well there there was some some reporting
and
that was right around the same time in
kind of late october
where this, uh, this started to come to
the fore
you know there were some fairly
speculative
articles but again, you know, and this
speaks to
kind of the terror threats that stem
from these
these terrible, uh, things that were done
by
by the us department of justice the
intelligence agencies
and in conjunction with the media
so very often I'd get the
the worst death threats when some more
of these
really, uh, scandalous reports
come out and so the official warning or
the
the official notification for america
which is then
you know front page news was when, um,
the wash the washington post in april of
2017
had a, uh, a big big story about, you know,
revealing
my fisa warrants so
and again spun in a way that was kind of
advancing
a narrative for, uh, whoever whoever the
criminals were that
gave that that highly dangerous
information
to the media totally against the law
you know you've gotten multiple death
threats at different times in this
you know multi-year process tell me a
little bit about, you know, the the
the cost to you your relationships what
what happened
you know I never lose sight of the fact
that the biggest cost
was what was done to president Trump
and really our core american
institutions in terms of our justice
system
the u.s constitution and again
some organizations that I've really
supported
for throughout most of my life, you know,
quarter century
uh with with some ties to the
intelligence
community u.s intelligence community so
to me, you know, yes there were huge costs
and
we'll see, um, you know, there's some
glimmers of hope, you know, as we've seen
over recent days that there there may be
some justice but
you know it remains to be seen and you
know some of it may be
dependent upon what happens in this, uh,
upcoming election just given the, uh,
you know I think the deceitful behavior
and the complete lies that we can
continue to see out of the same
organization
such as the DNC which funded this first
complete sham interfering in our last
election in conjunction with the
obama biden administration but
so it was pretty, you know, it was pretty
intense it continues to be pretty
intense but
to me I'm I'm laser focused but just
because I think
you know so many core institutions in
america
you know a lot remains at stake and, um,
you know there remain serious unanswered
questions right now
what did you think when you learned that
the primary source I think as primary
sub-source
for the for the dossier of course this
completely discredited
uh, uh, steele dossier, um,
turned out to be not someone even based
in Russia but someone who had been
you know in the us as a, you know, think
tanker for
decades well, you know, what what's just
so
it's typical all I can say is it's
typical
of what's known as the washington swamp
right because, you know, that individual
who you're referring to used to be at
the brookings institution
right and people in washington are
trying to advance their own
agenda and I think, you know, this is just
a perfect
example of that and, you know, I talk
about in my book some of my interactions
with, uh, someone else in the brookings, uh,
institution at the time very very senior
uh senior person there and, you know,
again very little care
of doing the right thing and
a huge huge negative ramifications
as to the the horrendous impact it had
on our
on our core institutions in america
so, you know, you were spied on through
four, uh,
or yeah four fisa warrants I mean there
were several renewals
um, you know, face these
you know unprecedented privacy
violations
uh of course which expanded past you
uh to to people that you were connected
with throughout the campaign and beyond
um you have a number of lawsuits
that that you've initiated I think but
one of them was recently, uh,
dismissed right against the DNC, um,
what is the state of that and what are
you expecting to happen
well, you know, I think again part of the
challenge
has been the huge cover-up right I mean
we have some initial
indications of, uh,
what actually happened but, you know, some
of these details
and some of my pleadings have not, uh,
have not fully
um, you know, gotten a just
treatment given the fact that there's, uh,
you know there's so much more to be told
and, you know, these are
largely, you know, the only problems I've
had thus far
are procedural issues, you know, in terms
of the substance
and the core of my claims those very
much
remain intact so all I can say is
stay tuned and, you know, we'll have more
to say on that
in the time to come, you know, one quick
thought is
that something that emerged out of this
uh, you know,
Clinesmith plea and indictment and plea
is that the
crossfire hurricane started not as a
counterintelligent investigation but as
likely as a farah
investigation and that what do you make
of that
well there are certain, uh, indications
that they're
they're trying to pull that game on me
in terms of my
interaction with them the mueller team
as well which I talk about
a lot in the book so, you know,
again it's a level of complete deceit
and a level of, you know, spinning a story
and just
two totally separate, uh, systems of
justice
one for Trump supporters one for
military veterans the other for
you know again going back to what we
were just talking about
washington insiders just trying to
achieve their political and advancing
their personal objectives
which is tragic and I think, you know,
again in addition all the sort of
substantive
things that need to be reformed I think
it just
reflects a a deep cultural rot
within certain institutions, um, and
I'm really disappointed that the the
democrats have have done so much to
advance that Carter recently someone's
come forward
with a pretty detailed story
uh stephen schrage who's actually
someone pretty early on in this whole
saga if I if I can call it, you know,
invited you to
an event and he has, uh,
uh and I just wanted to see how you see
it
is does his story check out with your
own experience
you know so one of the things that
stephen schrage says
is that initially initially stefan
halper was
rather uninterested in you as a person
but then something
suddenly changed rapidly like a switch
went off
and suddenly he's deeply interested in
you is
is this how you remember things, you know,
i I laid this
all out in my in my book and this sort
of talks through the situation in
cambridge
and all these sort of dynamics
so, um, you know, i
stephen I i feel, uh, I feel really bad
what happened
you know he to him as well I i
in terms of getting caught up as they
say caught in the crossfire
of this, uh, craziness and but
you know it's very similar to so many
other members of the, you know,
Trump supporters and people that have
been trying to
you know want to see our country going
in the right direction
and just get, you know, swept up into all
kinds of
crazy, uh, false allegations etc so
you know again I always keep, uh, keep an
open mind and I still
you know so many open questions as to
what
what actually happened, uh, but I i really
think
there needs to be a lot more, uh, that
needs to come out
as to what the specifics are and
unfortunately
this is another example and I know this
is something that
uh chairman johnson chairman grassley
chairman graham
have all been pushing really hard to get
to the bottom of in terms of
you know what actually what was going on
in that
in that whole spy gate scandal what's
particularly
terrible about it and again I talk about
this in some length in my book
it's the dual standards of justice right
where well we don't want to leak
anything related to
uh professor halper right, you know, his
his name is not even in the 480 page
inspector general report
right but nonetheless there's all kinds
of false information
about me right and it's again part of
the reason I wanted to
write this book to help set set the
record straight but
we've seen just two complete different
standards of justice for
Trump supporters on the one one hand
versus these
uh highly paid government operatives
that are, you know, apparently just
advancing their own interests
for in many instances for personal gain
and for
political advantage to achieve certain
objectives
do you have any thoughts on
who or might be
looked at next when it comes to the
durham investigation
yeah I have always taken the approach
that
i like to see the facts I mean just just
like we've been talking about
and unlike the dossier
where these reckless people
are throwing all kinds of allegations at
out
you know I'm very cautious and I you
know
i like to I like to really know what the
full truth is before i
jump to any conclusions totally the
opposite of what the
comey yates rosenstein, you know,
doj FBI was involved in during those
years
um who would you say this book is for
it really is for the american public
and voters we our country
has suffered the most severe election
interference campaign in history
with this sham run by the democrats
funded by the DNC and concocted
by a lot of their agents lawyers
and really hiring foreign spies
to, you know, perpetrate this complete
fraud on the american public
so I think anyone who's voting
in the the 2020 election
and, you know, the american public more
broadly people of all ages
i think can really benefit from this to
understand better
what happened and some ideas as to
what steps can be done at this historic
junction
juncture to make sure that the terrible
crimes that were committed are
eventually
you know certain reforms are made to to
fix this
terrible problem some people say that
it may take a generation for people to
really
understand fully what happened
so that that's I'd love to hear your
thoughts on that the other part and
we you've alluded to this already a bit
but
the role of the media and all of this
well part of
their interrelated questions, uh, and you
know
again the interface between the
government
on the one hand in the media on the
other
um again a lot comes down to
what is disclosed what information
and I know there's been, you know, you and
your colleagues at epact times have
really done tremendous work in terms of
trying to get to the bottom
of what actually happened and, you know,
really hard-hitting
analysis, um, but, you know, there's still
a lot more that needs to be un, uh,
uncovered and again I did having been on
the inside
of this terrible scandal and
you know I wanted to tell all the truth
as to
uh what actually happened, you know,
in contrast to the, uh, the terrible bad
acts
that were done by people both within
government
and out of government to
perpetrate this fraud on the american
people
and to your point it very much
interrelates
with the media element as well because
you know there's this cozy attitude
or cozy culture in washington
where the media works very closely or
has these
you know intimate relationships in some
case
you know literally an intimate
relationship, uh,
between the media and intelligence
operatives
and government operatives and it really
leads to a
in many cases people just advancing
their own political
interests and their own political
objectives
and in doing so creating terrible damage
for our country
so just something I i really wanted to
to highlight and, you know, start exposing
just what the, uh, what the terrible
ramifications are
and what the, uh, some steps that can be
taken to
fix this horrendous problem well briefly
what are the ramifications
what I talk about in some of the final
chapters of my book
is the fisa fisa statute itself
you know given this complete sham and
this
national tragedy that occurred there's
very little confidence left in the fisa
process
you know it's just left as a empty shell
and, you know, differing levels of, uh,
of outrage but, you know, several, you know,
many members of congress
uh particularly on the republican side
have been, you know, called for serious
reforms
and so, you know, I think that is just one
specific aspect
you know when this has just been left in
shambles
the foreign intelligence surveillance
act which was created
in the wake of a for of a prior scandal
you know
during the church committee in the 1970s
they
they uncovered terrible surveillance
wrongdoing and they
put together this fisa statute to
reform the system and now here we are
over 40 years later and
it's even worse than anyone could have
imagined in
one of the greatest scandals of all time
certainly hope that
that we do see some work on reforming
some of these processes
um any final words before we finish up
just a, uh, great thanks to you and your
colleagues at epoch times for
all the incredible reporting you've been
doing and
really digging to the bottom of this and
again
so much is required to understand the
full picture
i think this book is an important
contribution which
looks at the the big picture and tries
to
give a more complete view from the
inside of what exactly happened
but I appreciate the opportunity to
speak with you and your colleagues and
it's, uh,
great to have the conversation with you
again today well such a pleasure to have
you Carter and
the book of course is abuse and power, um,
so so glad to have you on thanks again
really appreciate it
